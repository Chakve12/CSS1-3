                        <span>history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8</span>
                        <span>billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all</span>
                        <span>matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</span>

                            Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that explains all fundamental
                            forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
                        </li>
                        <li id="Li2">
                            Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the existence of additional
                            microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not point-like particles
                            but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.
